This project focuses on improving the user experience in gesture-based interaction systems by enhancing mouse control through the utilization of the Mediapipe library. While existing systems utilizing Mediapipe encounter pointer displacement issues when hand positions change abruptly, our proposed system addresses this challenge by tracking hand movement coordinates and calculating mouse pointer position based on the distance moved by the hand. This method enables precise control of the mouse pointer even with abrupt hand movements, thereby enhancing user experience. Additionally, our system allows users to control the mouse using a small part of the camera's wide angle, mapping it to any point on the screen. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution in controlling the mouse pointer, indicating its potential for broader applications in human-computer interaction.
